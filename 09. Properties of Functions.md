#### 1.  A function maps each element in its domain to exactly one element in its co-domain.
    
#### 2.  The image of a function is always a subset of its co-domain, but it is possible for it to be a proper subset (i.e., a subset with fewer elements) or even an empty set.
    
### 3.  The domain of a function can be any set, including the empty set.
    
### 4.  The co-domain of a function can be any set, including the empty set.
    
### 5.  The domain and co-domain of a function can be the same set or different sets.
    
### 6.  The domain, co-domain, and image of a function are all sets, and therefore have no duplicates.

### In this photo, the first instance where 1 -> P, 2->Q and 3->Q is a valid function as it satisfies the property that says that each element in its domain is mapped to exactly one element in its co-domain.

### However, in the second set of Domain and co-domain, 2 is mapped to P and 2 is also mapped to Q which violates the fact that each element in its domain mapped to exactly one element in its co-domain, hence it is not a function.
