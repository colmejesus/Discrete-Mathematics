## Direct method for evaluating a polynomial 

The direct method for polynomial evaluation involves calculating the value of a polynomial for a given input value, without using any other computational tools such as Horner's method or synthetic division. Here is the step-by-step explanation of the direct method for evaluating a third-degree polynomial:

1.  Write down the polynomial: Let's take the example of a third-degree polynomial: P(x) = 3x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x + 1
    
2.  Choose a value for x: Let's choose the value x = 2
    
3.  Substitute the value of x into the polynomial: P(2) = 3(2^3) + 2(2^2) - 5(2) + 1 = 3 * 8 + 2 * 4 - 10 + 1 = 24 + 8 - 10 + 1 = 21
    
4.  Evaluate the expression: 21
    
5.  The result is the value of the polynomial at x = 2, which is 21.
    

This is the direct method for polynomial evaluation. It is a straightforward method that involves simply substituting the value of x into the polynomial and then evaluating the expression. However, for larger polynomials, this method can become very time-consuming and error-prone. In such cases, other methods such as Horner's method or synthetic division may be more efficient.

## Horner's method of evaluating the polynomial:

Horner's method is a more efficient way of evaluating a polynomial for a given value of x. Here is the step-by-step explanation of the Horner's method for evaluating a third-degree polynomial:

1.  Write down the polynomial: Let's take the example of a third-degree polynomial: P(x) = 3x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x + 1
    
2.  Choose a value for x: Let's choose the value x = 2
    
3.  Write down the polynomial in Horner's form: To use Horner's method, we need to write down the polynomial in a specific form, which is: (...((3x + 2)x - 5)x + 1).
    
4.  Start from the inside: Evaluate the expression inside the innermost parenthesis first. In this case, 3x + 2. Substitute x = 2, so the expression becomes 3 * 2 + 2 = 8 + 2 = 10.
    
5.  Replace the expression with its value: Replace the expression (3x + 2) with its value, which is 10. So, the polynomial becomes: (...((10)x - 5)x + 1).
    
6.  Repeat the process: Evaluate the expression inside the next parenthesis, which is (10)x - 5. Substitute x = 2, so the expression becomes 10 * 2 - 5 = 20 - 5 = 15.
    
7.  Replace the expression with its value: Replace the expression (10x - 5) with its value, which is 15. So, the polynomial becomes: (...(15)x + 1).
    
8.  Evaluate the final expression: Evaluate the final expression (15)x + 1. Substitute x = 2, so the expression becomes 15 * 2 + 1 = 30 + 1 = 31.
    
9.  The result is the final value of the polynomial, which is 31.

## Greatest Common Divisor:

The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two or more integers is the largest positive integer that divides all the numbers evenly. It is a commonly used concept in mathematics and computer science, particularly in the field of cryptography.

Here is a direct method for finding the GCD of two integers by dividing both the numbers by every number possible, collecting them in a set and finding the greatest number that divides both of them, step by step:

1.  Decide on the two numbers: Let's say we want to find the GCD of 42 and 56.
    
2.  Create a set of the divisors of both numbers: Create a set of all the positive integers that divide both 42 and 56 evenly. To do this, divide both numbers by each positive integer and add the divisor to the set if it divides both numbers evenly.
    
3.  Find the largest number in the set: Once you have all the divisors in the set, find the largest one. This will be the GCD of the two numbers.
    

Example: The divisors of 42 are `[1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42]`. The divisors of 56 are `[1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56].` The common divisors are `[1, 2, 7, 14].` The largest common divisor is 14, so the GCD of 42 and 56 is 14. 

This method is a direct approach to finding the GCD of two numbers, but it can be time-consuming and not very efficient for larger numbers. However, it is a useful method to understand the concept of the GCD and can be done by hand without the use of a computer.

Here is another method for finding the GCD of two integers, step by step:

1.  Decide on the two numbers: Let's say we want to find the GCD of 42 and 56.
    
2.  Divide the larger number by the smaller number: In this case, divide 56 by 42. This gives us a result of 1 with a remainder of 14.
    
3.  Replace the larger number with the remainder: Replace 56 with 14.
    
4.  Repeat the division process: Divide 42 by 14. This gives us a result of 3 with a remainder of 0.
    
5.  The GCD is the last non-zero remainder: In this case, the GCD is 14.

This method of finding the GCD is called the Euclidean algorithm, and it is one of the simplest and most efficient methods for finding the GCD of two integers. By repeating the division and replacement process, we eventually get to a remainder of 0, which means that the last non-zero remainder is the GCD. This method can be done by hand and does not require the use of a computer.
