### What is a recurrence relation? 

A recurrence relation is a way of describing a sequence of number by relating each term in the sequence to one or more previous terms. 

To solve a recurrence relation means to find a way to describe $n$$^t$$^h$ of the sequence directly, without having to compute all the previous terms. This direct way of describing the $n$$^t$$^h$ term is called a "Closed form expression". It's a formula that only depends on the value of $n$ and not on any previous terms. 

Once we have a closed-form expression for the nth term, we can use it to compute any term in the sequence without having to compute all the previous terms.

#### A simple example of a Recurrence Relation: 

Consider the sequence of numbers {a_n} defined by the recurrence relation:

a_1 = 1

a_n = a_{n-1} + 2, for n > 1

This means that the first term in the sequence is 1, and each subsequent term is equal to the previous term plus 2. Using this definition, we can compute the first few terms of the sequence as follows:

a_1 = 1
a_2 = a_1 + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3
a_3 = a_2 + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5
a_4 = a_3 + 2 = 5 + 2 = 7
a_5 = a_4 + 2 = 7 + 2 = 9
and so on.

The base term in a recurrence relation is the initial term of the sequence that is given explicitly in the definition of the relation. In the example above, the base term is a_1, which is given as 1. The recurrence relation then tells us how to compute all the subsequent terms of the sequence.

#### Fibonacci series:

The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the previous two numbers. The sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two previous numbers. So, the first two terms are 0 and 1, and the third term is the sum of the first two terms (0+1=1), the fourth term is the sum of the second and third terms (1+1=2), and so on.

In terms of a recurrence relation, we can define the Fibonacci sequence as follows:

F(1) = 0

F(2) = 1

F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 2

This means that the first term is 0, the second term is 1, and each subsequent term is the sum of the previous two terms. We can use this recurrence relation to compute any term in the sequence.

So, the Fibonacci series is an example of a recurrence relation where each term is defined in terms of the two previous terms.
