## One-to-One function:

A one-to-one function, also called a one-to-one correspondence, is a type of mathematical function, where each input function maps to exactly one output value, i.e. no two different input values can produce the same output. For example:

Let A = {1, 2, 3} be the set of domain and B = {a, b, c} be the set of co-domain. Then a set of one-to-one functions f from A to B could be defined as follows:

f1(x) = a if x = 1 
f1(x) = b if x = 2 
f1(x) = c if x = 3

f2(x) = c if x = 1 
f2(x) = a if x = 2 
f2(x) = b if x = 3

f3(x) = b if x = 1 
f3(x) = c if x = 2 
f3(x) = a if x = 3

And so on. In each of these functions, each element of set A maps to a unique element of set B, so these functions are one-to-one functions from A to B. 

Here's a visual representation of a one-to-one function:

The set of domain and ranges on the left side corresponds to a one-to-one function as for each value of x i.e. x1 and x2 there is a unique output value i.e. f(x1) and f(x2) but it is not the case with the set of values and their ranges on the right.

When we plot the function and domain values on a graph, we can see that in a  one-to-one no horizontal line is passing through two points, i.e. one value of 'x' only corresponds with one value of 'y'.


## Onto functions:

Onto functions also known as 'Surjective' function is a function where every output of the function has at least one input function or in more mathematical terms it is a function where every element in range(co-domain) has a pre-image in the domain of the function.

A preimage, in the context of a function, is the input value that maps to a specific output value. Given a function f and an output value y in the range (c-domain) of the function, the preimage of y is the set of all input values in the domain of the function that map to y. Here's a visual representation of Surjective functions:

A graph of any function can be considered as onto if and only if every horizontal line intersects the graph at least one or more points. If there is an element of the range of a function that fails the horizontal line test by not intersecting the graph of the function, then the function is not surjective. The below-given image is an example of the graph of onto function:

## Inverse function:

An inverse function is a function that undoes the effect of another function. Given a function f, the inverse function of $f$, denoted as $f^-1$, is a function that takes an output value of f and returns the corresponding input value and vice versa, in mathematical terms, for any y in the range (co-domain) of the function f, f^-1(y) gives us the preimage of y under f.

The inverse function must satisfy these two conditions:

1. The inverse function must be a function, where for each output value of $f$ must map to a unique input value.
2. The composition of the function f with its inverse function f^-1 must be the identity function, meaning that for any x in the domain of f, f(f^-1(x)) = x.

If a function has an inverse, it is said to be invertible or bijective.

Graphical representation of an Inverse function:

Inverse function graphs have a fascinating relationship. In order to find an inverse function, the x's and y's must be flipped. This results in the inverse function graphs being the reflection of the original function over x=y. This also means the ordered pairs of the points in the inverse function are flipped.

The red dashed line is x=y. The other two graphs are inverses because the blue graph is a reflection of the black graph over x=y. This is also apparent in the ordered pairs. The x and y coordinates in point A are the same as in Point A', only flipped. This method also makes it easier to discern whether or not two graphs are inverses.
