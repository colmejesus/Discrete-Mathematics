## Different Ways Of Expressing Implication:

### A compound proposition joined using implication connective can be expressed in different ways, let's take an example statement here:

### "If a number is a multiple of 9 then it is also a multiple of 3"

### We can break down this compound proposition into two parts and use propositional variables to simplify the statement. 

#### P = If a number is a multiple of 9
#### Q =  it is also a multiple of 3

#### Hence the statement can be written as:
#### P → Q

#### This statement can be expressed in different ways, like:

##### 1. P is sufficient condition for Q i.e. A number being a multiple of 9 is a necessary condition for it to be a multiple of 3. 

##### 2. P only if Q i.e. A number is a multiple of 9 only if it is a multiple of 3.

##### 3. Q is necessary condition for P i.e. A number being a multiple of 3 is a necessary condition fot it being a multiple of 9. 

##### 4. Not Q implies Not P i.e. A number that is not a multiple of 3 cannot be a multiple of 9

## Converse and Contrapositive:

### The converse of an implication P → Q  is  Q → P i.e. 

### Converse of "If a number is a multiple of 9 then it is also a multiple of 3" is "If a number is a multiple of three it is a multiple of 9" 

### Contrapositive of an implication P → Q  is   ¬Q → ¬P i.e. "If a number is 'not' divisible by 3 then it is 'not' divisible by 9" 

# Equivalence: 

## P ↔ Q is logically equivalent to (P → Q) ∧ (Q → P)

### P is 'Necessary' for Q means P → Q

### P is 'Sufficient' for Q means Q → P

### P ↔ Q if and only if P is both 'Necessary' AND 'Sufficient' for Q.
