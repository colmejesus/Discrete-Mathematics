## In the context of discrete mathematics, a function is a mathematical object that associates a unique output to every input of a certain set, called the domain of the function. A function can be represented as a table or graph, mapping inputs to outputs. In mathematical notation, a function is typically represented by an equation with the independent variable on the left and the dependent variable on the right. Functions are used to model many real-world situations, such as the relationship between distance and time or the height of an object and its shadow length. The study of functions and their properties is a fundamental part of discrete mathematics.

### For example, consider the function f(x) = x^2. The domain of this function is all real numbers, and for each real number x, the function outputs its square. So, if x = 2, then f(2) = 2^2 = 4. If x = -3, then f(-3) = (-3)^2 = 9.

## Luhn Formula:

### Luhn formula, also known as Luhn algorithm or Mod 10 algorithm, is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, such as credit card numbers, IMEI numbers, National Provider Identifier numbers in the United States, and Canadian Social Insurance Numbers.

#### A checksum algorithm is a mathematical function that takes an input (e.g., a message, a file, or a stream of data) and returns a fixed-size string of characters, which is typically a "fingerprint" that represents the contents of the input. The purpose of a checksum is to detect changes or errors in the input data, by comparing the original checksum to a newly computed checksum of the same data. If the two checksums are the same, it is very likely that the input data has not been modified or corrupted during transmission or storage.

### The formula was developed by Hans Peter Luhn, an IBM researcher, in the late 1950s and it uses a simple check digit mechanism to verify the authenticity of the number. The Luhn formula works by dividing the number into digits, starting from the right-most digit, and performing operations such as doubling and summing the digits. The result of these operations is then used to verify if the number is valid.

### Luhn formula is widely used to prevent data entry errors and to prevent fraud in credit card transactions by verifying that the credit card number entered is valid. The formula is also used to verify the integrity of other types of identification numbers.

Here's how to use the algorithm to check if a sequence of number is valid or not:

**Step 1** – Starting from the rightmost digit, double the value of every second digit,

**Step 2** – If doubling of a number results in a two digit number i.e greater than 9(e.g., 6 × 2 = 12), then add the digits of the product (e.g., 12: 1 + 2 = 3, 15: 1 + 5 = 6), to get a single digit number.

**Step 3** – Now take the sum of all the digits.

**Step 4** – If the total modulo 10 is equal to 0 (if the total ends in zero) then the number is valid according to the Luhn formula; else it is not valid.

### In mathematics, a function, as already discussed above, is a relation between a set of inputs (known as the "domain") and a set of possible outputs (known as the "codomain"), with the property that each input is related to exactly one output.

## Here are the terms and notations used when dealing with functions:

### 1. The notation f: X -> Y is used to denote a function f with domain X and codomain Y. Here, X and Y are non-empty sets, meaning they contain at least one element. The symbol "->" is read as "maps to".

### 2. The domain of a function is the set of all inputs (or arguments) for which the function is defined. In other words, it's the set of all values that can be plugged into the function.

### 3. The co-domain of a function is the set of all possible outputs (or values) that the function can produce. In other words, it's the set of all values that the function could return for a valid input.

### 4.  Image (or Range): The image (or range) of a function is the set of all actual outputs that the function produces for a given set of inputs. It is the set of all values that the function actually returns for elements in the domain.
