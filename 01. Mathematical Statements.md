## Mathematical Statements or also known as propositions are declarative staments that can be either true or false but can't be both.

### Examples of a Mathematical statement/proposition: 

#### 1.  7 is a prime number. `[True]`
#### 2.  2+3 = 5 `[True]`
#### 3.  12+10 = 17 `[False]`
#### 4. Every Set is a finite set. `[False]`

### Examples of statements that are non-mathematical:

#### 1.  `x` is a prime number.
#### 2. Mathematics is fun.
#### 3. How are you?
#### 4.  `x+y=23`
#### 5. `x+y=z`
#### 6.  3-x=5

### Types of Mathematical Statements:

### 1. Atomic Statements:

#### Type of declarative statements that can not be broken down into smaller statements. For example:

##### 1. Moon is made of cheese.
##### 2. Indian phone numbers have 10 digits.
##### 3. He is a nice chef.
##### 4. 25 is a perfect square.

#### 2. Molecular statements: 

#### Type of declarative statements that can be broken down into smaller statements 

#####  1. Zero is a positive and a negative number.
#####  2. 25 is a perfect square and an odd number.
#####  3. That was either very brave or very stupid! 


## Logical Connectives:

### We can connect two atomic statements and create a molecular statements also known as 'compund proposition' using Logical Connectives:

##### There are 5 Lgical Connective:

##### 1. And (∧) : Conjuntion
##### 2. Or (∨) Disjunction 
##### 3. If....Then (→) Implication/Conditional
##### 4. If and Only If (↔) Equivalance/Biconditional
##### 5. Not  ( ¬) Negation

##### The first 5 connective are binary connectors since they apply to two atomic statements and the last connective Not is called a 'Unary' cnnective because it applies to a single statement.

## Propositional Variables:

### Propositional variables can is any literal that can be used to represent a declarative statement for eg. 

### Adam is good at playing football and this time he is representing is college.

### Since this is a compound proposition it can be broke into two parts:

#### 1.  Adam is good at playing football. 
#### We can represent this part using any literal, lets say 'P'

#### 2. this time he is representing is college.
#### Let's Represent this statement using a literal 'Q'

#### Therefore this statement can be written as:

#### P ∧ Q
