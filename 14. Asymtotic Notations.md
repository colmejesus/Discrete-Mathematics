## Asymptotic notation is a way to describe the performance of an algorithm or a function in terms of its input size. It's commonly used in computer science to analyze the efficiency and scalability of algorithms.

## There are three main types of asymptotic notations: Big-O notation, Omega notation, and Theta notation. Each of these notations describes a different aspect of the performance of an algorithm, and they can be used to compare different algorithms and to choose the most efficient one for a given problem.

### 1.  Big-O notation (upper bound): Big-O notation is used to describe the upper bound or worst-case scenario of the performance of an algorithm. It gives an estimate of the maximum time an algorithm can take to complete, as the size of the input grows towards infinity.

### Formally, we say that a function f(n) is O(g(n)) if there exist positive constants c and n0 such that f(n) <= c * g(n) for all n >= n0.

### In this context, the notation "Θ" stands for "theta of", which basically means that we're looking at the exact rate of growth of the function as the input size increases.

### Now, let's look at the example you provided. The function f(n) is said to be Θ(g(n)). This means that the rate of growth of the function f(n) is exactly the same as the rate of growth of the function g(n).

### In other words, we can find some positive constants c1, c2, and n0 such that c1 times g(n) is less than or equal to f(n), which is less than or equal to c2 times g(n), for all values of n greater than or equal to n0.

### For example, if we choose c1 = 1, c2 = 2, and n0 = 1, then we can see that for all n greater than or equal to 1, n is less than or equal to 2n. This means that f(n) = n is Θ(n).

### In simple terms, this means that the function f(n) grows at the same rate as the function g(n). It's not slower, and it's not faster. The functions have the same rate of growth, which indicates that the algorithm has a consistent runtime for different input sizes.

#### Big-O notation examples: a) Consider the following function that calculates the maximum value in an array of size n:
 
```java
function max(array):
  max_val = array[0]
  for i in range(1, n):
    if array[i] > max_val:
      max_val = array[i]
  return max_val
```

#### The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), because it iterates over the array once, performing a constant number of operations for each element.

#### b) Consider the following function that sorts an array of size n using the bubble sort algorithm:

```java
function bubble_sort(array):
  for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n-1-i):
      if array[j] > array[j+1]:
        array[j], array[j+1] = array[j+1], array[j]
  return array
```

#### The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2), because it performs a nested loop that iterates over the array twice, and performs a constant number of operations for each element.

## 2.  Omega notation (lower bound): Omega notation is used to describe the lower bound or best-case scenario of the performance of an algorithm. It gives an estimate of the minimum time an algorithm can take to complete, as the size of the input grows towards infinity.

### Formally, we say that a function f(n) is Ω(g(n)) if there exist positive constants c and n0 such that f(n) >= c * g(n) for all n >= n0.

#### For example, the function f(n) = n^2 is Ω(n), since for some constant c and n0, f(n) >= c * n for all n >= n0.

### The function f(n) is said to be Ω(g(n)). This means that the rate of growth of the function f(n) is at least as fast as the rate of growth of the function g(n).

### In other words, we can find some positive constants c and n0 such that f(n) is greater than or equal to c times g(n), for all values of n greater than or equal to n0.

### For example, if we choose c = 1 and n0 = 1, then we can see that for all n greater than or equal to 1, n^2 is greater than or equal to n. This means that f(n) = n^2 is Ω(n).

### In simple terms, this means that the function f(n) grows at least as fast as the function g(n). It may be slower, but it won't be any faster. The functions have a lower bound on their rate of growth, which indicates that the algorithm has a minimum runtime for different input sizes.

####  Omega notation examples: Consider the following function that checks whether a given element is present in an array of size n:

```java
function search(array, target):
  for i in range(n):
    if array[i] == target:
      return i
  return -1
```

#### The time complexity of this algorithm is Ω(1), because if the target element is found at the first index, only one operation is performed.

#### b) Consider the following function that sorts an array of size n using the merge sort algorithm:

```java
function merge_sort(array):
  if len(array) <= 1:
    return array
  mid = len(array) // 2
  left = merge_sort(array[:mid])
  right = merge_sort(array[mid:])
  return merge(left, right)

function merge(left, right):
  result = []
  i = j = 0
  while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
    if left[i] < right[j]:
      result.append(left[i])
      i += 1
    else:
      result.append(right[j])
      j += 1
  result.extend(left[i:])
  result.extend(right[j:])
  return result

```

#### The time complexity of this algorithm is Ω(n log n), because it divides the array into two halves recursively, and merges them by performing a constant number of operations on each element.

### 3.  Theta notation (tight bound): Theta notation is used to describe the tight bound or average-case scenario of the performance of an algorithm. It gives an estimate of the actual time an algorithm takes to complete, as the size of the input grows towards infinity.

### Formally, we say that a function f(n) is Θ(g(n)) if there exist positive constants c1, c2, and n0 such that c1 * g(n) <= f(n) <= c2 * g(n) for all n >= n0.

### For example, the function f(n) = n^2 is Θ(n^2), since for some constants c1, c2, and n0, c1 * n^2 <= f(n) <= c2 * n^2 for all n >= n0.

### Now, let's look at the example you provided. The function f(n) is said to be Θ(g(n)). This means that the rate of growth of the function f(n) is the same as the rate of growth of the function g(n).

### In other words, we can find some positive constants c1, c2, and n0 such that c1 times g(n) is less than or equal to f(n), which is less than or equal to c2 times g(n), for all values of n greater than or equal to n0.

### For example, if we choose c1 = 1, c2 = 2, and n0 = 1, then we can see that for all n greater than or equal to 1, n is less than or equal to 2n. This means that f(n) = n is Θ(n).

### In simple terms, this means that the function f(n) grows at the same rate as the function g(n). It's not slower, and it's not faster. The functions have the same rate of growth, which indicates that the algorithm has a consistent runtime for different input sizes.

### 3.  Theta notation examples: a) Consider the following function that calculates the factorial of a given number n:

```java
function factorial(n):
  if n <= 1:
    return 1
  else:
    return n * factorial(n-1)
```

### The time complexity of this algorithm is Θ(n), because it recursively calls itself n times, performing a constant number of operations for each call.

### b) Consider the following function that searches for a given element in a sorted array of size n using the binary search algorithm:

```java
function binary_search(array, target):
  left = 0
  right = n-1
  while left <= right:
    mid = (left + right) // 2
    if array[mid] == target:
      return mid
    elif array[mid] < target:
      left = mid + 1
    else:
      right = mid - 1
  return -1
```

### The time complexity of this algorithm is Θ(log n), because it divides the array into halves in each iteration, performing a constant number of operations for each comparison.
