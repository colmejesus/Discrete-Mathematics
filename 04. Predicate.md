## Predicate in a proposition expresses the nature of that statement. For eg. 

### 1. Every natural number is an integer. In this statement "is an integer" is the predicate.

### 2. He is a good player. In this proposition 'good player' is the predicate but it is not clear wheather the proposition is True or False unless we know who 'He' is.

#### 3. Now lets consider a mathematical function P(x): x is greater than 7. In this statement as well 'greater than 7' is the predicate but it will only be true for some numbers as there are numbers that are less than 7, hence we can not say if this proposition is true without knowing what 'x' is?

## Quantifiers:

### Quantifiers are words that describe number of elements pertained by a proposition/mathematical statement.

#### There are two types of quantifiers:

#### 1. Universal Quantifiers: . It is used in mathematical statements to indicate that a satement applies to all the members of a given set. It is denoted by an upside down A (∀), which is read as "for all" or "for every". For eg. 

#### For all natural number n, n>0 can be written using universal quantifier as 
#### ∀n (n∈N) => (n>0)

#### For all negative numbers n, n<0 can be written as ∀n (n∈N) => (n<0)

#### For all animals (x), they need food to survive. ∀x (x ∈ animal) => (x needs food to survive)

#### Exestential Quatifiers: The exestential quantifier is used to indicate that a statement applies to atleast one members of a given set. It is denoted by a backword E (∃), which is read as 'There exists' or 'For Some'. For eg. 

#### There exists a natural number (n) grreater than 5. ∃n (n ∈ natural number) => (n>5)

#### There exists a prime number (p) smaller than 10. ∃p (n ∈ prime number) => (p<10)

#### "There exists a person in this room whose name starts with the letter 'J'" can be written as "∃x (x ∈ person) and (x is in this room) and (name of x starts with 'J')"


# Predicate Logic or First Order Logic: 

### It is a branch of mathematics that deals with the formalization (process of using language that makes statements more precise and not open to more than one interpretation) of a propositional statement.

### In predicate logic a statement is made up of a subject and a predicate for eg. "He ate my ice-cream", here 'He' is the subject and "ate my ice-cream" is the predicate, another exaple can be "x is greater than 7" In this statement x is the subject.

### Considering another example: 
### A triangle three sides can be written as "For any triangle x, x has three sides" the latter statement being more precise. Formalization can also be used to prove validity and consistancy of logical statements.

### Predicate logic provides a set of rules for manipulating propositional statements and it also provides a set of logical connectives to combine more than one statement, it also provides a set of rules than can be used to deduce propositional statements 

#### In a sentence prediacte describes the properties or relationsships between elements of a set, they are usually represented by 'P' or 'Q' with variables being represented by 'x' or 'y' 

## Syntactic Analysis:

### It is the process of detecting the syntactic structure of a sentance or a text in Natural Language Processing models in rder for a computer to understand and process the underlying grammer of the text. First order logic is used in Syntactic Analysis to break down the sentance into phrases that can be understood by a computer. Here's how syntactic analysis is done:

## Context Free Grammar(CFG): 

### It is a set of rules used that tells you how to put words and phrases together to make sentences. Suppose you have a sentance about maths, "2+3=5", we can say that we have a set of words like '2', '3', '5', '+', '='. CFG gives us a set of non-terminal symbols lie 'expr', 'term', '→' which can be used to replace the terminal symbols and put together a sentance. CFG is a set of rules that tells us how to put the words we have in terms of non-terminal symbols such as such as "expr → expr + term"


### This way of organizing a language using non-terminal symbols allows to easily understand and analyze the structure of the sentences. The non-terminal symbols provides a way to represent the meaning of the sentence in a more abstract way, which makes it easier to reason about the structure of the sentence and to understand the meaning of the sentence.

### Furthermore, these sentences that use non-terminal symbols allow for automated processing of the language, such as parsing and generation, with the use of a CFG. This can be extremely useful in fields such as natural language processing, programming languages etc.
