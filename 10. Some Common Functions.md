## Modulo Function:

### The modulo function is a binary operation that returns the remainder of the division of one integer by another. It is typically denoted by the symbol % in programming languages, and is defined as follows: for two integers a and b, where b is non-zero, the modulo function gives the result of a % b = r, where r is an integer between 0 and b-1, inclusive, such that a = b * q + r for some integer q.

### In the context of functions, the modulo function can be considered as a mapping from the set of pairs of integers (a, b) where b is non-zero, to the set of integers between 0 and b-1, inclusive. The function takes in two inputs, a and b, and outputs the remainder of the division of a by b. It is a useful tool for many applications in computer science and engineering, such as cryptography, error detection and correction, and random number generation.

### Modulo can be used to extract digits from a number by repeatedly dividing the number by a power of 10 and taking the remainder. For example, to extract the last digit of a number, we can perform the following calculation:

```makefile
last_digit = number % 10
```

### This gives us the remainder when `number` is divided by 10, which is exactly the last digit of `number`.

### To extract other digits, we can repeatedly divide the number by a power of 10, then take the remainder. For example, to extract the second to last digit, we can do the following:

```makefile
second_to_last = (number / 10) % 10
```

### We first divide `number` by 10, which removes the last digit, then take the remainder when the result is divided by 10, which gives us the second to last digit.

### This technique can be repeated for each digit we want to extract, by dividing the number by increasingly larger powers of 10 and taking the remainders.



## Hash Function:

### A hash function is a function that maps a set of input values to a set of output values, usually with a smaller number of possible outputs than inputs. Hash functions have several important properties, including being deterministic (the same input always maps to the same output), efficient to compute, and having a low collision rate (different inputs are unlikely to map to the same output).

### In the context of computer science, hash functions are commonly used to implement data structures such as hash tables, where the input value (such as a key) is hashed to an index in an array, allowing for fast and efficient access to the corresponding data. They are also used in cryptography for message authentication and integrity checking.

### A hash function `f(x)` takes an input value `x` and maps it to a fixed-size output value, typically a string of bits. The output is typically called the hash value or message digest. The size of the output value is typically much smaller than the size of the input value, so it is common for multiple input values to map to the same output value, known as a hash collision. The goal is to choose a hash function that minimizes the number of hash collisions.

### Hash functions can make use of the modulo operation in a few different ways. One common approach is to use the modulo operation to reduce the size of the output value to a smaller number of bits. For example, if the output value of a hash function is a 256-bit string, the modulo operation can be used to reduce this to an 8-bit value, such as:

```
f(x) = h(x) % 2^8
```

### Where `h(x)` is the original hash function and `2^8` is the desired number of bits in the output value.

### Another way that hash functions can use the modulo operation is to map the hash value to an index in an array, such as in a hash table. For example, if we have an array with `m` elements, and we want to map the hash value `h(x)` to an index in the array, we can use the modulo operation as follows:

```
index = h(x) % m
```

### This will give us an index in the range `0` to `m-1`, inclusive, that we can use to store or retrieve data in the array.

### In both of these cases, the modulo operation is used to reduce the size of the output value and map it to a smaller range of values, which is useful for many applications of hash functions.



## Pseudo-random numbers:

### Pseudo-random numbers are sequences of numbers generated by a deterministic process that simulate the statistical properties of truly random numbers. In other words, pseudo-random numbers are generated by a mathematical formula, but they appear to be random when tested with statistical tests.

### Pseudo-random numbers are generated using algorithms known as pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs), which start with a seed value and use mathematical operations to produce a sequence of numbers that have a certain degree of randomness. Since the sequence of numbers generated by a PRNG is deterministic (i.e., depends only on the seed value), it is not truly random, but can be useful for many applications where randomness is desired, such as cryptography, simulations, and games.

### Pseudo-random numbers are widely used because they are easy to generate and can be made to approximate true randomness. However, it is important to understand that the sequence of numbers generated by a PRNG can eventually be predicted if the seed value and the algorithm used to generate the numbers are known, so they are not suitable for cryptographic applications that require true randomness.

### The formula for generating pseudo-random numbers typically involves starting with a seed value and then using mathematical operations such as multiplication, addition, and modulo to produce the next value in the sequence. One well-known example of a formula for generating pseudo-random numbers is the linear congruential generator (LCG), which can be defined as follows:

```
Xn+1 = (a * Xn + c) % m
```

### Where `Xn` is the current value in the sequence, `a` and `c` are constants, and `m` is the modulus. The seed value `X0` is used as the starting value for the sequence.

### This formula generates a sequence of numbers by taking the current value, multiplying it by a constant `a`, adding another constant `c`, and then reducing the result to the range `0` to `m-1` by taking the remainder when divided by `m` (using the modulo operation).

### In simple terms, the formula for generating pseudo-random numbers is a mathematical recipe that uses a starting value (the seed) and a set of operations (multiplication, addition, and modulo) to produce a sequence of numbers that appear random. However, since the sequence is determined by the seed and the operations used, the numbers are not truly random.

### What is seed?

### The term "seed" in the context of pseudo-random numbers refers to the starting value used to initialize the algorithm that generates the sequence of numbers. The seed is used as input to the algorithm, and the sequence of numbers generated will depend on the seed value.

### Think of the seed as a secret number that you input into the algorithm to start the process of generating a sequence of numbers that appears random. Each time you use the same seed value, you will get the same sequence of numbers, so it is like replaying a pattern. However, if you use a different seed value, you will get a different sequence of numbers.

### In practical terms, the seed is used to ensure that the sequence of numbers generated by the pseudo-random number generator is unique and can be repeated if desired. By starting with a different seed, you can generate a different sequence of numbers that appears random.


## Floor and Ceiling Functions:

### The floor and ceiling functions in discrete mathematics are used to determine the largest integer that is less than or equal to a given real number (floor function), and the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to a given real number (ceiling function).

### The floor function is denoted by the symbol "⌊ x ⌋", where x is a real number. The floor of a real number x is the largest integer that is less than or equal to x. For example, the floor of 2.7 is 2, and the floor of -2.7 is -3.

### The ceiling function is denoted by the symbol "⌈ x ⌉", where x is a real number. The ceiling of a real number x is the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to x. For example, the ceiling of 2.7 is 3, and the ceiling of -2.7 is -2.

### Both the floor and ceiling functions are commonly used in mathematics and computer science, particularly in the areas of rounding, estimation, and discrete optimization. They can be used to round real numbers to the nearest integer, or to determine the number of units required to represent a given real value.


## Encoding and Decoding Functions:

### In discrete mathematics, encoding and decoding functions are used to transform data from one form to another. Encoding functions take the original data and map it to a new representation, while decoding functions take the encoded data and convert it back to its original form.

### For example, consider the following simple encoding function:

#### Encoding function: E(x) = 2x + 1

### This function takes an integer x as input and maps it to a new representation, 2x + 1. To decode the data, we simply need to apply the inverse function:

#### Decoding function: D(y) = (y - 1) / 2

### This function takes the encoded data y and maps it back to the original representation, x. To verify that the encoding and decoding functions are correct, we can substitute the encoded value into the decoding function and check that it returns the original value:

#### x = 3 y = E(x) = 2 * 3 + 1 = 7 x' = D(y) = (7 - 1) / 2 = 3

### In this example, the encoding and decoding functions form a bijective mapping, meaning that each value in the original domain is mapped to exactly one value in the encoded domain, and vice versa.

### Encoding and decoding functions are used in many areas of computer science, including cryptography, data compression, and error correction, to name a few.

## Hamming Distance Function:

### Hamming distance is a measure of the difference between two strings of equal length. It was introduced by Richard Hamming in 1950 and is widely used in computer science and information theory.

#### Given two strings of binary data, the Hamming distance is defined as the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different. For example, consider the following two binary strings:

### `110101 100011`

### The Hamming distance between these two strings is 3, as there are three positions at which the bits differ: at the first, third, and fifth positions.

### Hamming distance is used in various applications, including error detection and correction, data compression, and DNA sequence analysis. It provides a way to quantify the difference between two binary strings, and is a useful tool for evaluating the performance of error-correcting codes and other data transmission schemes.

### The idea behind error correction is to add redundant information to the original data so that errors can be detected and corrected when they occur.

### For example, consider a binary data transmission system that uses a Hamming code to detect and correct errors. The original data is first transformed into a redundant code using an encoding function, which adds extra bits to the original data. This redundant code is then transmitted over a noisy channel, where errors may occur.

### At the receiving end, the redundant code is decoded to recover the original data. The decoding process involves computing the Hamming distance between the received code and a set of valid code words, and selecting the code word with the smallest Hamming distance as the correct code. If the Hamming distance between the received code and the closest code word is greater than a certain threshold, then an error is detected, and the receiver uses the redundant information in the code to correct the error.

### This error correction process is based on the fact that the Hamming distance between two binary strings provides a measure of the number of errors that have occurred in the transmission. By using a Hamming code that adds redundant information to the original data, the receiver can detect and correct errors that may have occurred during the transmission.

### Boolean Functions: 

### A Boolean function is a mathematical function that maps a set of inputs to one of two outputs: either true (represented by the value 1) or false (represented by the value 0). In the context of discrete mathematics, Boolean functions are also known as binary functions or switching functions.

### A Boolean function can be represented as a table that lists all possible input combinations and the corresponding output values.

### Here's an example of a Boolean Function, and it's representation in terms of domain and range values being mapped:

### Boolean functions are widely used in computer science, especially in the design of digital circuits and the implementation of algorithms. Boolean algebra provides a set of rules for manipulating Boolean functions that make it easier to simplify and analyze digital circuits. Additionally, Boolean functions can be used to model the behavior of logical systems and to specify the design of digital circuits and algorithms.
